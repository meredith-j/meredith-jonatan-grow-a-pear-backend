ðŸŒ± What is Grow A Pear?

When preparing for my first garden last spring, I found that it was really hard to find accurate information on what plants would work in my backyard. Answer a few simple questions about where you live and how much sun you get in your backyard â€“ Grow a Pear will give you a list of plants that will thrive in your care!!

There are no websites with accurate & easy-to-read data on what plants you can grow. Lots of bloggers will write about their own experiences gardening, but the plants they grow are very specific to the climate & sun exposure their plants are getting. Alternatively, there are lots of plant stores â€“ but all of them are built with the purpose of selling you a product, not necessarily providing you with the information you need to choose the perfect product for you.

This website will help gardeners (from complete newcomers to pros) plan out their outdoor gardens with accurate information on what plants will thrive in their environments. They will use this application at some point ahead of their outdoor gardening season to plan out what theyâ€™ll need to purchase & when itâ€™s time to start planting their seeds for the next year.

The most important design feature is to make sure that the content on Grow a Pear is straightforward and easy to understand without overwhelming new gardeners with too much information.
